SpendIQ AI
AI-driven Cloud \& AI Cost Management with FinOps + DevOps + GenAI

📌 Overview
SpendIQ AI is an intelligent cost management and forecasting solution that combines:
FinOps principles – visibility, optimization, and accountability of cloud spend
AI/ML forecasting models – predicting future cloud \& AI workload costs
Generative AI (GenAI) – natural language insights, executive summaries, and what-if simulations
DevOps integration – automated cost governance gates in Azure DevOps pipelines

This project helps organizations reduce cloud waste, forecast AI spend, and align engineering with finance.

🚀 Features
📊 Spend Forecasting – Predicts cloud and AI-related spend using ML models
🔍 Anomaly Detection – Identifies unusual spikes in resource costs
🤖 Generative AI Assistant – Natural language Q\&A, executive summaries, and scenario planning
🔧 DevOps Integration – Azure DevOps pipeline checks for cost thresholds before deployments
💡 FinOps Alignment – Supports reporting, accountability, and showback/chargeback practices

⚙️ Tech Stack
Cloud: Azure (AI Services, ML Studio, Cost Management APIs)
ML/AI: Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Prophet, OpenAI SDK)
DevOps: Azure DevOps Pipelines, Repos
GenAI: Azure OpenAI (GPT models for summaries \& Q\&A)
FinOps: Based on FinOps Framework (visibility, forecasting, optimization)

📈 Demo Use Cases

Forecast Cloud Spend → “What will our Azure GPU cost be next month?”
Detect Anomalies → Alerts if costs spike 40% in a day.
GenAI Executive Report → Auto-generated weekly summary: “Your cloud spend increased 12% due to GPU scaling in AI workloads.”
DevOps Gate → Block deployment if estimated costs exceed budget.
